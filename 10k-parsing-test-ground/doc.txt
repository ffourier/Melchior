(1)Represents the aggregate principal amount of $827 million and anticipated interest payments of $4 million for the Convertible Notes. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2)Represents the aggregate principal amount of $2.00 billion and anticipated interest payments of $430 million for the Notes. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(3)Excludes operating lease payments that we expect to make under an operating lease financing arrangement following construction of a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The amount of the operating lease payments will be determined after the completion of construction. See the section below titled “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for additional information.

(4)Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $96 million which consists of $83 million and the related interest and penalties of $13 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 29, 2017. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.

(5)Our operating expenses for the fiscal year 2017 included $3 million of restructuring and other charges related to the wind-down of our Icera modem operations. The $13 million represents the remaining balance of the restructuring liability as of January 29, 2017.

•We recorded an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation within income tax expense, rather than in APIC, of $82 million for fiscal year 2017.

•We recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of February 1, 2016 to increase retained earnings by $353 million, with a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets, to recognize the federal net operating loss and federal research tax credit carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation that had not been previously recognized in APIC. We also recorded deferred tax assets of $63 million with a corresponding full valuation allowance related to state net operating loss and state research credit carryforwards.

•The excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation is now included in net operating cash rather than net financing cash in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We elected to apply this change in presentation prospectively and thus prior periods have not been adjusted.
